# PandorasJar
Random stuff to put together and collaborate on...and yes, it was actually a jar...

## Purpose

Why are we doing this?

  * To Collaborate
  * To Learn
  * To Create
  * To Have Fun

## Inspiration & Ideas

What inspires us for this?  What do we actually want to create?

In no particular order:

  * Tensegrity Structures - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity
    * Habitation Modules
      * Long Term - Dense, Populated & Poverty Stricken Areas
      * Temporary - Disaster Recovery and Response
      * Temp -> Perm - Space Dwelling?

  * Anything with Flying :)
      * Arduino-Based ARDUPilot
        * Once we get flying down, we could start experimenting with building a UAV of out own and gradually design our own fully autonomous UAV.
        * Hardware is already available and there are many different flight controller platforms to mess with.

* 3D Modeling
    * Large Scale - Outdoors, VR/AR, Mapping
    * Small Scale - 3D Printing and such
    
* Arduino
    * Responsive models 
      * Could be tied in with tensegrity models possibly, I don't think the nature of opposing compression/tension menbers lends itself to movement, but who knows
    * Kinetic Sculptures

## Next Steps

What do we do next?
  
  * Setup Project Expectations and Commitment
  * Choose Project
  * Scope Requirements
  * Gather Resources
    * Software
    * Hardware
  * Setup Environment(s)
  * Create Documentation and Workflow Process
  * Track & Update Progress
  * Measure Success (how?)

## Resources & Notes

We can put things here for reference or KB type stuff.
